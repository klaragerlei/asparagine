# asparagine
generate input geometries of Asn for Gaussian

The following scripts were generated to study the multidimensional potential energy surface of the amino acid asparagine. The scripts build the a graph that represent the molecule and then rotate its 2 backbone and 2 side-chain dihedral angles to cover most structures in a 4d space. Input files for Gaussian09 are then generated by outputting these coordinates.
